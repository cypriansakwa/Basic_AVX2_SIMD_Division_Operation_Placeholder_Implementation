This project shows how to use Rust's AVX2 SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) intrinsics to do basic division. 
The code is meant to demonstrate the usage of AVX2 instructions for simultaneous processing of multiple data components, 
although it presently contains a placeholder implementation for division. 
For true performance-critical applications, a highly efficient approach should be utilized.

## Overview 
1. Functionality: The code defines the method avx2_div, which divides two __m256i vectors element-wise using AVX2 intrinsics.
2. Implementation: The current implementation converts SIMD vectors to arrays, conducts element-wise division, and then returns the result to a SIMD vector.
   This is a basic and inefficient strategy that is shown here for instructional reasons.
3. Usage: The example initializes two __m256i vectors with example values, divides them, and outputs the results.
